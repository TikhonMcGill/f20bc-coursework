#For concept's sake, here is an explanation of how a Neural Network would be codified as a particle:
#1. Go through every layer (except for the input layer)
#2. Get the weight matrix from the previous layer to this layer
#3. Flatten the weight matrix into a vector
#4. Concatenate the flattened weight vector with the biases for this layer
#5. All of the vectors for each layer concatenated together represent a particle

#There is no reason to write code to convert a Neural Network into a Particle, since the Neural Networks themselves
#Will only be evaluated and will do feeds forward - they will not be altered in any way, which means converting them
#into particles is unnecessary.

#for that layer in the Neural Network - this will be useful in converting Particles to Neural Networks
